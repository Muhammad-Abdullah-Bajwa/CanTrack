# CANADA-COVID-19-Tracker

This app uses [retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to pull data from the https://opencovid.ca api

It uses [EazeGraph](https://androidrepo.com/repo/blackfizz-EazeGraph-android-chart) to graph this data

A recyclerview is used to show a list of provinces and it is filtered based on what the user types in the search bar
